it is a fork of LINGOT - a musical instrument tuner
===================================

<img align="right" src="http://lingot.nongnu.org/images/lingot-black-main.png">

LINGOT is a musical instrument tuner. Itâ€™s accurate, easy to use, and highly 
configurable. Originally conceived to tune electric guitars, it can be used to
tune other instruments.

It looks like an analogue tuner, with a gauge or strobe disc indicating the
relative shift to a certain note, determined automatically as the closest note
to the estimated frequency.

this fork is created to add a virtual instrument (piano roll or a fingerboard)
to display frequencies as real notes

Main features
-------------

* It is free software, distributed under the 
  [GPL license](https://www.gnu.org/licenses/old-licenses/gpl-2.0.html).   
* Quick and accurate, perfect for real-time microtonal tuning. 
* Easy to use. Just plug in your instrument and run it. 
* _LINGOT_ is a universal tuner. It can tune many musical instruments, you only
  need to provide the scale _temperaments_. For that purpose, it supports the 
  [.scl format](http://www.huygens-fokker.org/scala/scl_format.html) from the 
  [Scala project](http://www.huygens-fokker.org/scala/).   
* Configurable via GUI. It is possible to change any parameter while the
  program is running, without editing any file.

Requirements
------------

* A modest computer running _GNU/Linux_. 
* A sound card with line-in or microphone input. 
* [Jack](http://www.jackaudio.org/), 
  [ALSA](https://www.alsa-project.org/main/index.php/Main_Page), 
  [OSS](http://www.opensound.com/oss.html) or 
  [PulseAudio](https://www.freedesktop.org/wiki/Software/PulseAudio/) support.   
* [GTK+](https://www.gtk.org/) library, version _3.10_ or above.

Installation
------------

If you are building a release, just type:

```console
./configure
make install
```

If you are building a development version obtained from our VCS you will first
need to create the _configure_ script, by calling:

```console
./bootstrap
```

The supported audio systems (alsa, oss, jack, pulseaudio) and the Fast Fourier
Transform [libfftw](http://fftw.org) library can be enabled/disabled
independently via options passed to the `configure` script. The following
command displays all options and defaut value.

```console
./configure --help
```

Below a summary of the packages needed to build a development version on
_Debian-based_ systems:

```console
sudo apt-get install \
    intltool \
    libasound2-dev \
    libcunit1-dev \
    libfftw3-dev \
    libgtk-3-dev \
    libjack-jackd2-dev \
    libjson-c-dev \
    libpulse-dev \
    libtool \
    pkg-config
```

Beware that LINGOT ships an experimental shared library, whose interface could
be subject to change. If you have trouble finding the library when launching the
aplication, please consider reporting a bug, and try setting the library path
to your installation location as a work-around:

```console
LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/usr/local/lib lingot
```

Synopsis
--------

```console
lingot [-c config]
```

The `-c` option causes the search of a file named `{config}.conf` in the
`~/.config/lingot/` folder. For example:

```console
lingot -c bass
```

will take the configuration file `~/.config/lingot/bass.conf`. This is useful
for maintaining different configurations for different instruments. It's also
possible to load and save configuration files from the GUI. The default
configuration file is `~/.config/lingot/lingot.conf`.
